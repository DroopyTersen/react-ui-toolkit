# React UI Toolkit

A suite of React components, hooks, and utilities that you can leverage to build enterprise applications.

## Installation

The `ui-toolkit` is not intended to be a blackbox NPM dependency. Instead it is tailored for copying the source code into your project so you can tweak it from there.

To pull `ui-toolkit` into your project, run the following from the root of your project

```bash
# Run from root of project, it will put everything in ./src/ui-toolkit
npx degit https://github.com/DroopyTersen/react-ui-toolkit/src/ui-toolkit src/ui-toolkit
```
